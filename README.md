Controller for wood carburetor oven including heating system control on a Raspberry Pi 1

This is just a backup for my code and files. Don't expect it to run for you. This code needs specific thermo sensors as well as a Flammtronic as a secondary controller. The Raspberyy GPIOs were connected to a relais card. The oven this ran on was a 60kW Orlan wood carburator.
